# Contrinuting Guidelines for WakaSkies
If you are reading this file and are thinking about making a PR, thank you! Having a community of contributors has always been a big dream for me.
This file will lay out some general guidelines to follow when contributing to this project.

## Feature Requests
Have an idea for a feature? Great! Please create an issue describing your feature idea. **Please specify if you are going to be the one implementing the feature.**
Once it has been discussed, you can now make a PR. (See [Making the PR](#making-the-pr))

## Bug Fixes and Optimizations
Most bug fixes and code optimizations do not need an Issue created. Please make a PR and state the changes made and how it makes the code better.
If you fixed a problem from someone's bug report, please link to the Issue.

## Discoverd a Bug?
Please make an Issue and provide as much information as you can.

## Making the PR
Once you have gotten approval for a request, or decided to patch a bug, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository.
- Create a new branch and title it with the feature/fix.
- Once the code is ready, make a PR on the main GitHub page.

## Unsure?
If you are unsure about what category your contribution falls under, please don't hesitate to create an Issue.
We will review your idea and point you into the right direction.

# Important
Please, please, please only use code that you have written yourself or code that has a permissive license. 
You **must** put attrubution (when required) into the code and into the project's README. The licence should go into the README.
